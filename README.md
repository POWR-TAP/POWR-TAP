# POWR-TAP 

We are dedicated to empowering American youth with essential financial knowledge and skills. Our primary project, TAP, is a financial literacy education platform that leverages blockchain technology and the XRPL to create an engaging, dynamic learning experience.

We believe that by providing accessible and engaging educational resources, we can help the next generation achieve financial literacy and success.

## About TAP

TAP is an engaging, video-based quiz gaming app that combines the best elements of social media platforms like TikTok and trivia games like HQ. Players receive push notifications with links to short quiz videos (1-2 minutes) containing essential financial skill-building information. By answering multiple-choice questions correctly, players can win $5, with two chances per quiz and bonus rounds for leveling up winnings.

Our design focuses on customized learning modules and a badging/tagging system that tracks players' performance and informs the leaderboard. In TAP, video-based quizzes are connected to multiple-choice questions. When players answer correctly, they receive badges that remain on their user profiles. This data is extracted by our Internal Reporting System, which calculates the cash rewards owed to each player during a given period. Once approved by our payment partner, FIS, the funds are distributed to users' debit cards for them to use at their discretion.

By blending the engaging nature of video content with the thrill of winning real money, TAP creates an exciting and dynamic platform for teaching financial literacy to American youth.
