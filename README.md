# POWR-TAP

## Architecture of Projects

TAP is a video-based, multiple-choice, pop quiz gaming app where players receive push notifications with links to quiz videos (1-2 minute runtime) that contain pertinent financial skill building information and must answer multiple-choice questions correctly to win $5. Each player is given two (2) chances per quiz and bonus rounds allow winners to level-up their winnings.

TAP by POWR is a combination of social media platform Tik Tok, in that videos are used to convey messaging, and HQ, which is a multiple choice, pop quiz trivia game that rewards winners with real money. We've taken the best of both worlds and added a few twists.

TAP is a financial literacy mobile app combined with backend systems that allow
for reporting and incentivized learning.

The reporting code is available in this repository under the `./data` directory
and the sub README in that folder contains the technical architecture of that
part of the project.
