# POWR-TAP

## Architecture of Projects

TAP is a financial literacy mobile app combined with backend systems that allow
for reporting and incentivized learning.

The reporting code is available in this repository under the `./data` directory
and the sub README in that folder contains the technical architecture of that
part of the project.
